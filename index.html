    <h2>CREATIVITY</h2>
    <p>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.<br /><em>- STEVE JOBS</em></p>
